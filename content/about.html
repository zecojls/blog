<p>I‚Äôm natural from Canoinhas, SC, Brazil. I‚Äôm 24 years old, a soccer fan (to watch and play) and a beer appreciator (in the future I want to start to produce my own beer). Currently, I‚Äôm taking the doctorate (Agriculture - Soils and Plant Nutrition) at University of S√£o Paulo, living at Piracicaba, Brazil.</p>
<p>About my interests and motivations, everything started when I took agricultural courses at the same time of the high school. I really enjoyed that time and I decided to continue studying agriculture at university.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate student, the use of technology and information has aroused me a great interest for a possible working area. I also liked the academia and had some fellowships in that period, which helped me to continue as a graduate student nowadays.</p>
<p>My main interests are related to the application of technology and data science in soil research, agricultural and environmental issues, by using automated analysis in programming languages (R,javascript) and free and open source software (mainly GIS, such as QGIS, SAGA, GEE).</p>
