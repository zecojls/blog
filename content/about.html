<p>I‚Äôm from Canoinhas, SC, Brazil. I‚Äôm 24 years old, a soccer fan (to watch and play) and a beer appreciater (in the future I wanna start to produce my own beer). I currently live at Piracicaba - SP with some friends.</p>
<p>My native language is portuguese and I decided to write things in this blog in both portuguese and english. I apologize if my english is not fluent, but I believe blogging here can help me to improve it.</p>
<p>About my interests and motivations, everything started when I took a technical course in agriculture at the same time of the high school. I really enjoyed that and I decided to continue studying agronomy.</p>
<p>As a undergraduate student, the use of technology and information in agriculture has aroused me a great interest for a possible working area. I also liked the academia and had some fellowships in that period, which helped me to continue as a graduate student nowadays.</p>
<p>Currently, I‚Äôm taking the doctorate (Agronomy - Soils and Plant Nutrition) at University of S√£o Paulo, and I intend to continue doing research or working on these subjects in the future.</p>
<p>My main interests are related to the application of technology and data science in soil research, agricultural and environmental issues, using the R programming language, and free and open source softwares (mainly GIS).</p>
