      <description>MotivationAt the end of last year, I started searching for smartwatches and decided to buy an Amazfit Pace. This watch is manufactured by the Chinese company Huami and has many functionalities with an affordable price when compared to other models. In addition, the modern and round design has also convinced me to buy it.
